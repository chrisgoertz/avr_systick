Systicks for my avr projects.
## Supported MCUs
For now i am tinkering around with my [ATmega1284p Devboard](https://github.com/chrisgoertz/ATmega1284p_DevBoard),
so this library supports only the ATmega1284p.
But most AVR devices share the same registernames, so there is a valid change,
that this library will work for other MCUs.
